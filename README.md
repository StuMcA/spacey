# Spacey is an educational app to teach children & teens about the cosmos!

Our solar system is beautiful and with this browser app both young and old can enjoy learning all about Sol, the planetary system we call home.

With facts, stats, pictures and a viewer of the planets in motion around the sun based on real distance and speed calculations, we at *Team Planeteers* hope you enjoy it!
